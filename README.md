# Inflation Injection

Constructor-inject views during XML layout inflation.

Looking for Assisted Inject? It's [built in to Dagger now](https://dagger.dev/dev-guide/assisted-injection.html)!


## Usage

Write your layout XML like normal.

```xml
<LinearLayout>
  <com.example.CustomView/>
  <TextView/>
</LinearLayout>
```

Use `@InflationInject` in `CustomView`:

```java
public final class CustomView extends View {
  private final Picasso picasso;
  
  @InflationInject
  public CustomView(
    @Inflated Context context,
    @Inflated AttributeSet attrs,
    Picasso picasso
  ) {
    super(context, attrs);
    this.picasso = picasso;
  }
  
  // ...
}
```

In order to allow Dagger to create your custom views, add `@InflationModule` to a Dagger module and
add the generated module name to its `includes=`.

```java
@InflationModule
@Module(includes = InflationInject_PresenterModule.class)
abstract class PresenterModule {}
```

The annotation processor will generate the `InflationInject_PresenterModule` for us. It will not be
resolved until the processor runs.

Finally, inject `InflationInjectFactory` and add it to your `LayoutInflater`.

```java
InflationInjectFactory factory = DaggerMainActivity_MainComponent.create().factory();
getLayoutInflater().setFactory(factory);

setContentView(R.layout.main_view);
```
